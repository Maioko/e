If you think this is going to permanently kill your pc it won't, it will only give you 5 different options none will break
so you don't have to be worried about it.

Windows defender will detect it be a virus/malware i promise it's not. all the file does is turn off computer.


If found a bug/broken command make the folder a zip file and ill check it out on discord @Maioko#0333
